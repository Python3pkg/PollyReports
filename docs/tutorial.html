<h1>PollyReports Tutorial</h1>

<p>
I've noticed that acceptance of a new software module or package for developers
in the Open Source/Free Software world is greatly affected by the availability
of a good tutorial.  I mean, it seems obvious, doesn't it?  But I've also
noticed that the original author of a project rarely writes a good tutorial. 

<p>
Well, I'm going to try it anyway.  Here's my first version:

<p>
<h2>Using PollyReports</h2>

<p>
PollyReports is a small, light module providing a simple way to generate
reports from databases using <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a>.  It is
designed for use with <a href="http://www.reportlab.com">Reportlab</a>, and a
basic understanding of that package will help a great deal in using
PollyReports.

<p>
The traditional way to get started with a new language is a "Hello, World"
program; while PollyReports is hardly a language, we'll begin the same way:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.
10.
11.
12.
13.
14.
15.
16.
17.
18.</div>
<div class=code>from PollyReports import *
from reportlab.pdfgen.canvas import Canvas

data = [
    ("Hello", "World"),
]

rpt = Report(datasource = data, 
             detailband = Band([
                 Element((36, 0),  ("Helvetica", 12),
                    key = 0),
                 Element((72, 14), ("Helvetica", 12),
                    key = 1),
             ]))

canvas = Canvas("sample01.pdf")
rpt.generate(canvas)
canvas.save()
</div>

<p>
Running this script results in a PDF file, the upper-left corner of which looks
like this:

<p>
<img class=display src="sample01.png">

<p>
The script begins by importing everything from PollyReports; all we actually
needed this time was Report, Band, and Element, but PollyReports is pretty
clean so I elected to import all of it.

<p>
Next we import Canvas from reportlab.pdfgen.canvas; for this simple example,
and in fact for many useful programs, that's all we need.

<p>
Lines 4-6 define our data source. Rather than querying a database, I'm just
providing the data for this example in literal format.

<p>
Lines 8-14 instantiate our Report object. We pass in the data variable as the
datasource, and define the detail band as a Band object. Band objects, in turn,
are provided with a list of Element objects when they are instantiated. These
Element objects define what data to print, what font to print it in, and where,
relative to the upper left corner of the Band, the data is to be printed. In
this example, both Elements use the key parameter to define what data to print
from each row of data; since the data source is a list of tuples, the keys must
be integer values.

<p>
Line 16 allocates a Canvas, which is passed to the Report's generate() method
on line 17. Line 18 completes the cycle, saving the canvas data to the file
named on line 16.

<p>
<h2>What happens when you generate() the Report</h2>

<p>
The generate() method of the Report object iterates through the data source.
For each row of data, the detail band iterates through its list of Elements,
generating a sort of a view of the detail band. This view is not printed, not
yet anyway; first, the Report.generate() method verifies if there is enough
room on the current page for the view to print. If there is, it is added to the
page (we say "rendered") and the loop starts over with the next record, if any.

<p>
When Report.generate() is called, there is no valid page, so the first detail
band does not fit and a new page (the first page) must be created.

<p>
<h2>A Larger Example</h2>

<p>
For the rest of this tutorial, I'll focus on reproducing an earlier version of
the testpolly.py script which is included with the source code distribution.
This script depends on the testdata.py module, which contains a sample
datasource in literal format, much like the pocket-sized version above.

<p>
The testdata.py data source consists of a list of dict objects, where each dict
object represents a row of data. Each dict in the list has three keys
associated with it: "name", "phone", and "amount". The last item, amount, is a
simple integer number which I will use to demonstrate creating subtotals and
grand totals.

<p>
Here's our first shot at testpolly.py, called sample02.py:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.
10.
11.
12.
13.
14.</div>
<div class=code>from reportlab.pdfgen.canvas import Canvas
from PollyReports import *
from testdata import data

rpt = Report(data)
rpt.detailband = Band([
    Element((36, 0), ("Helvetica", 11), key = "name"),
    Element((400, 0), ("Helvetica", 11),
            key = "amount", align = "right"),
])

canvas = Canvas("sample02.pdf", (72*11, 72*8.5))
rpt.generate(canvas)
canvas.save()
</div>

<p>
Again, we have imported Reportlab's Canvas and all the goodies in PollyReports.
The third line imports our faux dataset from testdata.py.

<p>
On line 5 we instantiate the Report. This time, just to show that I can, I have
omitted the detail band from the object instantiation; instead, I assign it to
the like-named attribute of the new Report object on lines 6-10. Our detail band
consists of the name and amount fields, the name printed 1/2 inch (36 points)
from the left edge of the page, and the amount printed 400 points from the left
edge.

<p>
Since the data source is a list of dict objects rather than tuples, the key
values used in the Element declarations are strings rather than integers.

<p>
Note on line 9 the extra named parameter <b>align = "right"</b>. This indicates to
PollyReports that the Element should be printed aligned to the right; thus, the
amount will extend to the left of (400, 0) rather than to the right.

<p>
Line 12 creates our Canvas object. This time, the page size is defined as 11 x
8.5 inches (given 72 points to the inch, of course). Reportlab has a pagesizes
module that could be used for this if you like; please consult the Reportlab
documentation for more information.

<p>
As before, the last two lines generate the output and saves it. The report is
six pages long; here's the upper-left corner of it:

<p>

<p>
<h2>Adding Page Headers and Footers</h2>

<p>
Let's dress it up a little bit. Rather than reprint the entire script, I'll
just show the part that needs to be added after line 9 in sample02.py:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.
10.
11.
12.
13.
14.
15.
16.</div>
<div class=code>rpt.pageheader = Band([
    Element((36, 0), ("Times-Bold", 20), 
        text = "Page Header"),
    Element((36, 24), ("Helvetica", 12), 
        text = "Name"),
    Element((400, 24), ("Helvetica", 12), 
        text = "Amount", align = "right"),
    Rule((36, 42), 7.5*72, thickness = 2),
])
rpt.pagefooter = Band([
    Element((72*8, 0), ("Times-Bold", 20), 
        text = "Page Footer", align = "right"),
    Element((36, 16), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
        sysvar = "pagenumber", 
        format = lambda x: "Page %d" % x),
])
</div>

<p>
There are three Element objects and one Rule declared in the page header. Each
of the Element objects uses the text = ... parameter (rather than the key = ...
parameter) to indicate what value the Element will have. The text parameter is
used whenever you want to print literal text, i.e. a label.

<p>
The Rule object is a new feature. A Rule is an Element-like object that renders
a horizontal line, starting at the given position, extending the given distance
to the right, having the given thickness. The default thickness is one point,
if it isn't given.

<p>
The page footer has two Elements, a standard text label and an Element using
the sysvar = ... parameter. The sysvar parameter gives you access to attributes
of the top-level Report object; at present, the only practical reason to need
this is to access the page number, which is exactly what is being done here.
The page number Element also contains the format parameter, which is used to
pass a formatting function into the Element. This function is used to convert
the data value into a printable text string; if not given, the default is to
use the built-in Python str function. Here, we're using a lambda function to
dress up the page number for printing.

<p>
Run the new script and you'll get this: 

<p>
<img class=display src="sample03-1.png">

<p>
And here's the bottom of the page, showing the page footer:

<p>
<img class=display src="sample03-2.png">

<p>
<h2>Adding a Report Footer</h2>

<p>
Printing out the data in the records is all well and good, but what we really
want to see here are some totals, right? Let's start with a grand total band,
also called a <b>report footer</b>. Again, I'll show only the part you need to
add; just put it after the code in the last section:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.</div>
<div class=code>rpt.reportfooter = Band([
    Rule((330, 4), 72),
    Element((240, 4), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12),
        text = "Grand Total"),
    SumElement((400, 4), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
        key = "amount", align = "right"),
    Element((36, 16), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
        text = ""),
])
</div>

<p>
Here we have a Rule, which has previously been explained, as well as a standard
text-type Element identifying this as the "Grand Total". The interesting bit is
the third item, a SumElement.

<p>
A SumElement, which really only works in group footers (described below) and
the report footer, automatically adds up its own value until you print it, at
which time the value is reset to zero. So, a SumElement in the report footer
will sum up its value and print it at the very end of the report. This
particular SumElement sums the "amount" field from our pseudo-database.

<p>
The last Element has a null string text parameter; the purpose of this is to
take up space, so that the report footer is guaranteed not to be too close to
the page footer.

<p>
Here's the report footer as it prints out on the last page of the report:

<p>
<img class=display src="sample04.png">

<p>
<h2>Group Headers</h2>

<p>
So, imagine for the moment that we want to break this list up alphabetically.
Don't ask me why... we just do. Here's how you add a <b>group header</b> band
which will print at the beginning of each "group" of rows:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.</div>
<div class=code>rpt.groupheaders = [
    Band([
        Rule((36, 20), 7.5*72),
        Element((36, 4), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
            getvalue = lambda x: x["name"][0].upper(),
            format = lambda x:
                "Names beginning with %s" % x),
    ], getvalue = lambda x: x["name"][0].upper()),
]
</div>

<p>
Again, we have a Rule to draw a line on the page; this one will be at the
bottom of the band. We have an Element, to print the first letter of the "name"
field. Here, we are using the getvalue = ... parameter, to define a function to
"compute" the data. The function referenced by getvalue receives a single
parameter, which is the current row. For a group header, the "current row" is
the first row of the new group (which has not yet printed). We're also using
format = ... in the Element to dress up the value a bit.

<p>
Line 7, above, shows a critical bit for a group header: how the Report knows
that the row has changed. Each group header band (and group footer band, for
that matter) has its own "value," and when that value changes, the band is
printed. Unlike Elements, a Band may only use the key or getvalue parameters to
extract its value. (At present, I can't think of any reason to allow text or
sysvar parameters.)

<p>
A Report may have more than one group header band (this is why they are
represented as a list). If a group header band is deemed to have changed, all
higher-level (i.e. earlier in the list) group headers are also reprinted, even
if they haven't "changed" <em>per se.</em>

<p>
Here's what the group header looks like printed:

<p>
<img class=display src="sample05.png">

<p>
<h2>Adding Group Footers</h2>

<p>
By now, this should seem old hat. A group footer band combines the techniques shown above for the report footer and group header bands. Here's the new code:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.
10.
11.
12.
13.
14.</div>
<div class=code>rpt.groupfooters = [
    Band([
        Rule((330, 4), 72),
        Element((36, 4), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
            getvalue = lambda x: x["name"][0].upper(),
            format = lambda x: "Subtotal for %s" % x),
        SumElement((400, 4), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
            key = "amount", align = "right"),
        Element((36, 16), ("Helvetica-Bold", 12), 
            text = ""),
    ],
    getvalue = lambda x: x["name"][0].upper(), 
    newpageafter = 1),
]
</div>

<p>
The only new feature shown here is on line 13: the newpageafter parameter.  If
true, newpageafter indicates that a new page should be forced after this band
is printed.  There is also a newpagebefore parameter, indicating that the band
should always be printed on a new page.  Neither newpagebefore nor newpageafter
apply to detail bands, page headers, or page footers, and newpageafter also
does not apply to the report footer.

<p>
<h2>Progress Indicator</h2>

<p>
It would be nice to be able to indicate to the user that his or her report is
being processed.  Most programs make use of a progress bar or other indicator
to show that everything is still working.  Other report generators use complex
event systems to arrange this; PollyReports does it all with
<b>Element.onrender</b>.

<p>
There are two different ways most developers would choose to indicate progress:
by counting rows and by counting pages.  Here's how we count pages.  First, add
this to the top of the script:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.</div>
<div class=code>import sys

def pagecount(obj):
    sys.stdout.write("%d " 
        % obj.parent.report.pagenumber)
    sys.stdout.flush()</div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
</div>

<p>
Next, change one of the page header Elements to include a call to this
function:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.
06.
07.
08.
09.
10.</div>
<div class=code>rpt.pageheader = Band([
    Element((36, 0), ("Times-Bold", 20), 
        text = "Page Header", 
        onrender = pagecount),
    Element((36, 24), ("Helvetica", 12), 
        text = "Name"),
    Element((400, 24), ("Helvetica", 12), 
        text = "Amount", align = "right"),
    Rule((36, 42), 7.5*72, thickness = 2),
])
</div>

<p>
All we've changed here is the addition of the <b>onrender = pagecount</b> parameter to the first Element.  It would be fine to add this to any one of the Elements in the page header.

<p>
Finally, change the last part so it reads like this:

<div class=numbers>01.
02.
03.
04.
05.</div>
<div class=code>sys.stdout.write("Report Starting...\nPage ")
canvas = Canvas("sample07.pdf", (72*11, 72*8.5))
rpt.generate(canvas)
canvas.save()
print "\nDone."
</div>

<p>
When you run this script, you'll see the following in your terminal window:

<div class=terminal>Report Starting...
Page 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 
Done.
</div>

<p>
Counting rows works much the same way, and is left as an exercise for the
reader...

<p>
<h2>That's All, Folks!</h2>

<p>
Well, that's it.  If you've hung in this long, you should have a pretty good
idea how to create reports with PollyReports.  Please submit questions or
